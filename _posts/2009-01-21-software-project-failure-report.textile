Last term I wrote a report entitled "The relationship between requirements & design and the failure of software development projects". It was graded as first-class and the top of the cohort. It provides a good overview as to why correct requirements elictation and subsequent analysis is so critical to project success.

<blockquote>This report looks at the relationship between requirements and design, and the failure of software projects. It investigates several key areas of requirements and design which often lead to failure, such as requirements analysis, prototyping, working with stakeholders, change control and software tools. Each area is subject to critical analysis whereby the strengths and weaknesses of typical processes are identified, and suggestions for their improvements are documented. A case study is included which supports the report by documenting the catastrophic failure of the Mars Orbiter programme.</blockquote>
