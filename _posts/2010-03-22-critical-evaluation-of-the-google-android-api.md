After developing a prototype application to be deployed on Google Android devices, I have documented my findings and evaluated the API from the cloud-computing perspective. The report was written for but is available for reading below.

<blockquote>This report provides an insight into the Google Android API. It documents an overview into development with the platform and provides a high-level design for a prototype used which demonstrates a subset of features. Following development of the prototype, experiences are documented and a critical evaluation of the API is formed.</blockquote>
